        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed</li>
            <li> tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>Â½ cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>2 green onions (white part only), chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.</li>
        </ol>
